| T3205199 | Check that the "snapshot" key isn't necessary and the user can create the Stripe source connector without (or an empty) this key (By default is true -> data that was added before starting the pipeline will be transferred)                     | Passed |         |
| T3205200 | The user can't create the Stripe source connector with an invalid values in the "snapshot" key (for example enter any text or digits, except for valid values) -> the system returns an error                                                     | Passed |         |

| T3205202 | Create the Stripe source with "snapshot":"false" ("also 0", "f", "F", "false", "FALSE", "False")-> data that was added before starting the pipeline will not be transferred (if add data during pause, data will be transferred after restarting) | Passed |         |
